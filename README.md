Bash Script Implementing Aspell

ï»¿Simple Spell Check Program in BASH using aspell

The program will take a file given as a command line argument and will spell check it using aspell. When a word that is misspelled comes up the script asks the user if they would like to correct the word or add it to the .memory file which is automatically created by the program. At the end the program outputs all of the misspelled words and their corrections.

NOTE: The corrections are not applied into the original file, this implementation is left out because there are many different ways this can be achieved and it is at the user's discretion!
